/// A sealed container for systems that may be executed in parallel.
///
/// Systems can be any closure or function that return nothing and have these 3 arguments:
/// - [`SystemContext`](struct.SystemContext.html),
/// - any tuple (up to 16) or a single one of "resources": references or mutable references
/// to `Send + Sync` values not contained in a [`hecs::World`](../hecs/struct.World.html)
/// that the system will be accessing,
/// - any tuple (up to 16) or a single one of [`QueryMarker`](struct.QueryMarker.html) that
/// represent the queries the system will be making.
///
/// Additionally, closures may mutably borrow from their environment for the lifetime `'closures`
/// of the executor, but must be `Send + Sync`. If none of the systems make any borrows from the
/// environment, said lifetime can simply be `'static`.
///
/// The generic parameter `Resources` of the executor must be a superset tuple of all resource set
/// tuples of the contained systems. Any type in `Resources` must appear no more than once,
/// however, any number of systems in the executor may have either an immutable or a mutable
/// reference of said type in their signature. For example: if any number of systems require
/// a `&f32` or a `&mut f32`, `Resources` must contain `f32`.
///
/// It's possible to define an order of execution of the systems by building up a dependency
/// graph when building the executor, see [`ExecutorBuilder::system_with_handle()`][swh].
///
/// [swh]: struct.ExecutorBuilder.html#method.system_with_handle
///
/// Executors are relatively costly to instantiate, and should be cached whenever possible.
///
/// Executors are not intended to house any and all behavior of the program, they work best
/// when treated as a sort of [`yaks::batch()`](fn.batch.html) for systems; e.g.,
/// make one only when the systems in it may actually benefit from being ran concurrently
/// and prefer several small executors over a single large one.
///
/// See [`::run()`](#method.run), crate examples, and documentation for other items in the library
/// for more details and specific demos.
